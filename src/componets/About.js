                <p> Hi, my name is Biagio Mendolia and I am a software engineer and recent Flatiron School Graduate. 
                    My journey to becoming a software engineer started a little less than a year ago 
                    when I discovered the Shopify platform and discovered a hidden passion I have for
                    creating web applications. 
                    Shorty after graduating College with my associates in Applied Science, 
                    I started Flatiron Schools full time Software Engineering porgram.
